            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The National Commission on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
                was an independent body created in 1989 by federal statute
                (Public Law 100-607). The mission of the National Commission
                was to advise Congress and the President on the development
                of "a consistent national policy" concerning the HIV
                epidemic. The statute created the Commission for a period of
                up to four years, which expired on September 3, 1993.
            </p>
            <p>
                The National Commission was preceded by the Presidential
                Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic,
                which was established on June 24, 1987, by Executive Order
                12601. The Presidential Commission held over 45 days of
                hearings and site visits in preparation of their final report
                to the President, which was completed on June 27, 1988. One
                of the recommendations of the final report was the
                development of a national commission on AIDS to continue
                their work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The National Commission consisted of fifteen members
                including five appointed by the Senate; five by the House;
                two by President George W. Bush Sr.; and the secretaries of
                Health and Human Services, Defense, and the Veterans
                Administration. The Commission accomplished its mission
                through numerous hearings and site visits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Commission's hearings covered the following topic
                concerning AIDS: healthcare, treatment, and international
                aspects of the HIV epidemic; Federal, State, and Local
                responsibilities; the Southern California epidemic; social
                and human issues; Executive and Legislative branch issues;
                current research and clinical trials; HIV epidemic in the
                Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; African American communities;
                Pediatric and Adolescent HIV; Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual
                communities among Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific
                Islanders; Women and HIV disease and civil rights; religious
                communities response; and risks of transmission in healthcare
                settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Site visits included Southern California community based
                organizations in order to observe their response to the
                epidemic. Other site visits also included the homeless in New
                York City, Newark, and Jersey City; AIDS in the rural
                communities of Waycross, Albany, and Macon, Georgia; HIV and
                AIDS in New York City correctional facilities; the epidemic
                in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; regional responses in
                Belle Glade and Miami, Florida; and the Native American
                Communities of Oklahoma, Minnesota, South Dakota, Arizona,
                and New Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
                During its tenure the Commission produced fifteen reports
                plus analytical and policy statements on a number of issues.
                AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy, the Commission's final report was
                issued in June 1993. The final report discusses the future of
                the AIDS epidemic in America and established two main
                recommendations on the appropriate response. The first
                recommendation was that leaders at all levels must speak out
                about AIDS to their constituencies. Secondly, we must develop
                a clear well-articulated national plan for confronting AIDS.
                The steps necessary to meet these guidelines are outlined by
                the Commission in Mobilizing America's Response to AIDS,
                which was sent directly to the President.

            <p>Briefing books, hearing and meeting transcripts, reports, and
                press clippings (1983-1993; 10.2 l.f.) document the
                activities of the National Commission on Acquired Immune
                Deficiency Syndrome (NCAIDS). Materials cover all but the
                last year of the Commission's existence. The majority of the
                collection consists of NCAIDS briefing books, and hearing and
                meeting transcripts. Series I contains hearing transcripts
                from the Commission's predecessor, the Presidential
                Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic
                (1987-1988); Series II contains the work conducted by NCAIDS.
                In Series III the collection also includes various topical
                reports on AIDS published by external agencies. There are no
                notes or correspondence in this collection and all materials
                appear here in published form. In addition, the Commission's
                report <title>Mobilizing America's Response to AIDS</title>,
                is also not included within this collection but can be found
                n the Library's General Collection. The bulk of the
                collection spans the years 1987 to early 1992.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collection comprises four series: Presidential Commission
                on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic, 1987-1988;
                Briefings and Transcripts of Hearings and Meetings,
                1989-1992; Press Coverage and Reports, 1989-1993; and Reports
                on AIDS from External Institutions and Government Agencies,
                1983-1992.
            </p>

                Of special interest is the Commission's final report <title>
                AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy</title>, which serves as a summary
